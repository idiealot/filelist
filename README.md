Finding files on a specified directory with a specified attribute
While browsing the internet I didn't find a good way to list files from a specified directory based on an attribute I was looking for.
In my case I wanted to be able to find files based on a date and upload them. I wrote something quickly to help anyone that's trying to find a good way to locate files based on an attribute and perform an operation on them.
